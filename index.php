                    <p>Understanding your hair type will help you better take care of your hair. Hair types can range in pattern, texture, ferosity, and other characteristics. The curly or wavy pattern in your hair is caused by the number of disulside bonds between the proteins in the hair shaft. The more bonds, the curlier the hair. When you get to know how hair acts and why, you can take better care of it by finding the appropriate products and routines that work for you. You can also learn to identify others who might have the same hair texture as you, in order to find other ways to keep your hair growing and healthy. </p>
